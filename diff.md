1. ```git diff``` : helps to see the differences created in the local file from the main repository.
You can exit the git diff command in terminal using the letter ```q```
2. ```git diff > changes.txt```
This will save the output of git diff to a file called changes.txt in the current directory. You can specify a different filename or directory path if you prefer.
Note that the > operator will overwrite the contents of the file if it already exists. If you want to append the output of git diff to an existing file, you can use the >> operator instead:

3. ```git diff >> changes.txt```
This will append the output of git diff to the end of the changes.txt file, rather than overwriting it.
